# Task 7 - Breast Cancer Classification using SVM

This notebook uses the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset for binary classification of tumors as malignant or benign using Support Vector Machines.

## Steps Performed:
1. Data loading and preprocessing
2. Label encoding ('M' = 1, 'B' = 0)
3. Feature scaling using StandardScaler
4. Train/test split (80/20)
5. SVM training with Linear and RBF kernels
6. Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
7. Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
8. PCA-based visualization of decision boundary (2D)

## Requirements:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
