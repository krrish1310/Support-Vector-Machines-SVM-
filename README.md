# Task 7: Support Vector Machines (SVM)

## 📌 Objective
Use Support Vector Machines for both linear and non-linear classification using the Breast Cancer dataset.

## 📁 Files Included
- `Task_7_SVM.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with all steps implemented
- `breast-cancer.csv.xls` – Dataset used
- `README.md` – This file

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, pandas, numpy

## ✅ Steps Performed
1. Loaded and cleaned the breast cancer dataset.
2. Scaled features using `StandardScaler`.
3. Trained SVM with linear and RBF kernels.
4. Evaluated model performance with accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
5. Tuned hyperparameters `C` and `gamma` using `GridSearchCV`.
6. Visualized the decision boundary in 2D using PCA.

## 🧠 Key Concepts Learned
- Margin maximization in SVM
- Kernel trick (Linear vs. RBF)
- Model tuning via grid search
- Visualization of high-dimensional data in 2D

## 📊 Results
- Achieved high classification accuracy with RBF kernel after tuning.
- Visualized how SVM separates classes in reduced dimension space.
